#+TITLE: Testing PPT

* Goal
  To make sure ~ppt~ works pretty well.

* Components
  The tests are laid out by functionality, not to mirror the source code base.
  This lets me move functionality around during refactors, mostly.
** TODO Parsing
** TODO In-Memory Layout
   - Relative ordering should be preserved
   - Padding should be minimal
   - Sizes between frames in same buffer should be the same.
** TODO Code Generation
** TODO Attach                                                      :COMPLEX:
*** A good place to shove a backwards-compat attach test
    - Mostly worried about older layout systems and JSON schema
    - That don't exist yet.
*** Rate adaptation
** TODO Decode
** TODO Computing Derived Values
** TODO Live Monitoring

* Organization
  - Create *Spec and *Gen modules for different components
  - Then pipeline them.
    - So that generated data from one can then be processed normally in the
      next phase, creating the next *Spec.  E.g., ParserGen -> LayoutGen.
