PURPOSE
-------
libmet provides a minimal raw-data instrumentation library for
capturing and storing measurements.  It works to minimize intrusion
into system performance and is intended to work with very high rates
of data.

The measurements are (abstractly) represented in a table, with each
column being a different measurement, and each row a synchronized
'frame' of values.  For example, a single iteration of a main loop
would be a single frame, containing one table cell per measurement.

Using some macros, a data structure is filled with measurement data
and that structure is written to disk.  

INSTALLATION

CONSTRAINTS
-----------
The primary frame data storage is a global variable, a structure
optimized to minimize the number of cache lines read per measurement
store and frame-save.

HOW TO USE
----------
Define your frame measurement type, a variable of that type,
and a frame-buffer for storing raw data.
